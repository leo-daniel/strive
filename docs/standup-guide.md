## Students Do: First Stand-up

* In this activity you will take part in your first stand-up with your group mates. Regular stand-ups help ensure everyone is on the same page with what they are working on and everyone gets help they might need.

## Instructions

* Before your first stand-up, each member of the team should go through the "To Do" column of the project board and self-assign at least one issue. 

  * To do this, click on the issue and on the right choose "self-assign".

* Everyone should have a clear idea of what they think they can accomplish today. Now it's time for your first stand-up!

* Stand if you are able - yep, stand-ups take place standing; this helps to ensure that the meetings are short and to the point. 

* Each member of the team should say: 
  * What they did yesterday 
  * What they plan to do today 
  * What, if anything, is blocking their progress. 

* Stand-ups should be held **daily** from this point forward - yes even days that you don't have class (use Slack or Google Hangouts).
